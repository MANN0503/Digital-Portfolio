        <p>Problem Statement</p>
        <p class="problem-statement">
            The agricultural sector faces several challenges that necessitate the development of a crop prediction system using machine learning. 
            Some of the existing problems include:
            <br><br>
            ➢ Unpredictable crop yields, inefficient crop selection, suboptimal agricultural practices, lack of yield estimation accuracy, uncertain 
            weather patterns due to climate change, limited access to information, and the need for sustainable a griculture.
            <br>
            ➢ Addressing these problems through a crop prediction system can greatly benefit farmers, optimize practices, mitigate risks, and contribute 
            to sustainable and profitable farming.
        </p>
        
        <p>Proposed Solution</p>
        <p class="proposed-solution">
            Crop prediction involves analyzing required fertilizers like Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus (P) and potassium(K) in Kg per hectare and by considering rainfall, 
            humidity contents and weather parameters and display the required seed for a cultivation in Kg per acre for recommended crop.
            The proposed solution is to develop a crop prediction system using machine learning. The system will collect comprehensive data on crop yield, weather, 
            soil composition, and other relevant factors. Machine learning algorithms will be employed to build predictive models for crop yield estimation.
            <br><br>
            • The models will be trained and optimized, and their performance will be evaluated using established metrics.
            <br>
            • The system will be implemented with a user-friendly interface, allowing farmers to input data and receive real-time predictions for crop selection and yield estimation.
            <br>
            • The integration of machine learning models will enable personalized recommendations based on user input.
            The system aims to empower farmers with data-driven insights, optimize agricultural practices, and maximize crop yields. The results and findings will be presented, and future research directions will be outlined. Overall, the crop prediction system using machine learning will revolutionize agricultural decision-making and enhance productivity in a sustainable manner.
