        <p>Problem Statement</p>
        <p class="problem-statement">
            Can we create a machine learning model that can study the dataset of a 
            patient with or without liver disease and predict the further steps to be taken with accuracy?
        </p>
        
        <p>Proposed Solution</p>
        <p class="proposed-solution">
            After doing a lot of research, we found out that there are still many healthcare organisations or medical centres which 
            lag in the accuracy and prediction of liver disease which leads a human to a life-threatening condition. To overcome this 
            condition, we decided to collect the medical data from the national recognised organisations in order to do analysis. 
            Once we have completed our analysis, we can create a portal which will study and predict the input dataset.
